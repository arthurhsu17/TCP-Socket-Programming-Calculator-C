# TCP-Socket-Programming-Calculator-C
2 number calculator using client and server connection made using C. Simple arithmetic can be done such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
The gist is that there are two programs made, one being the receiver and one being the sender. Once a connection has been made to the correct specified port, the server(receiver) will prompt the client(sender) to send the first number, and subsequently the second number, then after will ask for the choice of arithmetic of what the user wants. Attatched are screenshots of what the program does.

As seen above, a connection is established and the server awaits for user import in the client side.
